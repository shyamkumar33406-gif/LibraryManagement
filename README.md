# ðŸ“š Library Management System (Java OOP Project)

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
This project is part of the *Java Developer Internship Task 3*.  
The goal is to develop a *mini Library Management System* using *Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)* principles in Java.

It demonstrates:
- *Encapsulation* (using private fields & getters/setters)  
- *Abstraction* (Library hides internal implementation)  
- *Inheritance & Polymorphism* (extendable for future features)  

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Requirements
- Java (JDK 8 or later)  
- Any IDE (VS Code / IntelliJ / Eclipse) or terminal  
- Git (optional, for version control)  

---

## âœ… Features Implemented:

Add books

Show available books

Issue a book

Return a book

Track books issued to a user

You can copy-paste these 4 files

(Book.java, User.java, Library.java, Main.java) into your Java project, compile,Â andÂ run.
